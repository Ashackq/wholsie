                                <p><strong>Thank you for shopping with Wholesiii.</strong> This Shipping &amp; Delivery Policy outlines how we handle deliveries for purchases made through wholesiii.com or other sales channels operated by us. By placing an order, you agree to the terms described here.</p>

                                <h3>2. Shipping Locations</h3>
                                <p>We deliver across major cities and towns in India via trusted courier partners. If your location is not serviceable, we will contact you to discuss alternatives.</p>

                                <h3>3. Order Processing Time</h3>
                                <p>Orders are typically processed within 1–2 business days of payment confirmation. Orders placed after business hours or on weekends/public holidays are processed the next working day. During high demand, processing times may extend slightly; we will keep you informed.</p>

                                <h3>4. Shipping Charges</h3>
                                <p>Free shipping on orders above ₹500. A flat shipping fee of ₹50 applies to orders below the free-shipping threshold.</p>

                                <h3>5. Packaging</h3>
                                <p>Products are packed in air-tight, moisture-resistant, tamper-evident packaging to maintain freshness and quality during transit.</p>

                                <h3>6. Delays and Delivery Issues</h3>
                                <p>While we strive to deliver on time, delays may occur due to courier network issues, incorrect addresses, or natural events. If your order is delayed beyond the expected window, contact us at <a href="mailto:wholesiii@gmail.com">wholesiii@gmail.com</a> for assistance.</p>
