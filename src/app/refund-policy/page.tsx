                                <p>We believe in helping our customers as far as possible, and have therefore adopted a liberal cancellation policy.</p>
                                <p>Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made within 2 days of placing the order. Cancellation requests may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to vendors/merchants and they have initiated shipping.</p>
                                <p>For damaged or defective items, please report the same to our customer service team within 2 days of receipt. The request will be entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the same at their end.</p>
                                <p>If you feel that the product received is not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, notify customer service within 2 days of receiving the product. The team will review your complaint and take an appropriate decision.</p>
                                <p>For products that carry a manufacturer warranty, please refer issues directly to the manufacturer. In case of any refunds approved by DIVAINE LEAF NEUTRA PRIVATE LIMITED, it will take 1–2 days for the refund to be processed to the end customer.</p>
